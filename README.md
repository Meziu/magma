# sdlfun
## Overview
This is a personal project to make my first steps into user applications. I've always been a CLI guy, 
but the new knowledge from Rust gave me confidence about trying out some new things. 
This project uses `SDL2` and `OpenGL` to deliver crossplatform and general purpose support.
