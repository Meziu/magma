# Pholidota
## Overview
This is a personal project to make my first steps into user applications. I've always been a CLI guy, 
but the new knowledge I got from Rust gave me confidence to try out Graphic APIs. 
This project mainly uses `SDL2` and `Vulkan` (through the rust crate Vulkano) to deliver crossplatform desktop support.
